This is the true beginning of the story of Jones's last days.

Step 1: Following the Heart (And Finding a Wall)
It started with a worry that had curdled into fear. Jones had watched Cody, the boy he’d practically raised, get swallowed whole by Lance Sterling’s Pioneer’s Vigil. The hero worship that had once been directed at him was now aimed at a zealot. It was a personal failure, and Jones felt its weight. Before turning to the city’s shadows, he turned to his last true friend: Brick Samson.
He went to the Star Bar, not as an investigator, but as a friend asking for help. The place was quiet. He slid the old, faded photograph across the worn bar top. The image of the two of them, younger, invincible, a lifetime ago. He pointed to the note he’d written on the back: "Watch out for the Kid."
"He's in trouble, Brick," Jones said, his voice low. "Sterling's got his hooks in him. Gage Riley is his shadow. They're planning something. I need your help to pull him out before it's too late."
Brick looked at the photo, then at the door, then at the bottle in his hand. The fear in his eyes was stark, cutting through the usual alcoholic haze. He pushed the photo back across the bar. "Leave it alone, Johnny," he said, his voice barely a whisper. "This is different. Sterling and his boys... they're not a joke anymore. You cross them, you end up in a cryo-tube in Ur-Ea's morgue. I can't. I'm just a bartender."
Jones looked at his friend, the man who had flown into the heart of a nebula with him on a dare, and saw a stranger. He picked up the photograph, the promise on the back now a testament to a friendship that had just died. He was alone. If he was going to uncover what Sterling was planning and save the kid, he'd have to do it himself. He put the photo in his pocket and walked out, leaving Brick to his fear and his bottle.
The Clue Left Behind (Found on Jones's body): An Old Photograph. It shows a younger Jones and Brick Samson. On the back, a note: "Brick - Remember the promise we made. Watch out for the Kid." This is the key to the entire investigation. It's not just a memento; it's the record of a plea for help. It identifies the first person Jones turned to, and the first person who turned their back on him. It points to Brick not just as a source of information, but as the first domino to fall in a story of betrayal.

Step 2: Following the Tech
Jones knew a war, even a suicidal one, needed weapons. Not just blasters, but real hardware. The kind you can’t buy over a counter. There was only one place in the city to get that kind of off-the-books, military-grade tech: Pavel’s chop shop in the Undercrawl.
Jones went to see the Mole Man. Pavel, terrified but pragmatic, would sell to anyone. Jones didn’t make a scene. He just asked what kind of components Gage Riley had been buying. For a handful of credits, Pavel showed him. It was heavy stuff—shielding components, power conduits, navigational systems. All of it scavenged, all of it dangerous. To have a tangible piece of evidence, Jones purchased a small, representative item from the same lot: a non-standard power cell, already showing signs of overload from Pavel’s crude tests.
The Clue Left Behind: A Burned-Out Power Cell. It’s non-standard, military-grade, and clearly overloaded. On its casing is the faint, almost invisible maker's mark of Pavel's chop shop, a stylized mole's claw inside a cog. This is the first thread. It leads directly to the source.
Of course. Here is the next step in the timeline, detailing Jones's logical progression and the next clue he uncovers.

Step 3: Following the Logic
Jones had the list of parts. Shielding, high-yield power conduits, navigational arrays. This was more than a stockpile; it was a project. But what was it for? He wasn't a theoretical physicist, but he knew one. The only mind in the city brilliant enough to see the design behind the components and paranoid enough to understand its implications was Lugal.
Navigating the treacherous junk fields to the crashed Zetan saucer was a risk, but Jones was methodical. He approached the fortified scrap heap and was granted access. Inside the shielded cockpit, surrounded by the quiet hum of defensive systems, Jones presented his findings to the reclusive Gray. He showed him the list of scavenged Terran tech.
Lugal, his mind a precision instrument, saw the pattern immediately. This wasn't just a power source for a ship. The specific combination of energy shielding and navigational hardware pointed to something far more dangerous. It was a crude, brutalist attempt to replicate a Zetan stealth field generator—a "cloaking device." Lugal explained it would be dangerously unstable, a ticking bomb that could tear a hole in reality. To give Jones the proof he needed, and a warning, Lugal handed him a small data crystal containing the theoretical specifications, showing how the scavenged Terran parts were being dangerously jury-rigged to a Zetan design concept.
The Clue Left Behind: A small, damaged Zetan Data Crystal. To make the complex theory understandable, it's wrapped in a piece of flimsiplast. On the flimsiplast is a hand-drawn diagram showing the crystal's schematics interfacing with a Terran power system, with the name "Lugal" scribbled next to a note on energy fluctuation. The clue identifies not just the technology but the expert who can explain it.
Excellent. The investigation continues, following the cold, hard logic of resources.

Step 4: Following the Resources
Jones now knew what they were building. The next question was where. A project of that magnitude—an unstable, jury-rigged cloaking field—would generate a catastrophic amount of heat. It would need a massive, dedicated cooling system. In Ignition City, industrial-grade coolant means one thing: water. And all water flows from one place.
His investigation led him to the rusted, skeletal frame of the Discovery One, the city's water condenser station. He confronted the facility's sole operator, Hemi. The Gill-Man was terrified. Creatures like Hemi survive by being invisible, by not making waves. But Gage Riley, Sterling's blunt instrument, had already paid him a visit. Under Jones's quiet, persistent questioning, Hemi's resolve crumbled.
He confessed he'd been strong-armed by Riley into diverting a massive quantity of purified water, far more than anyone could ever drink. It was pumped out under the designation "hyper-coolant." Hemi, fearing for his life, had rerouted the shipment to a disused reclamation valve at the edge of the scrap fields, a place no one ever goes. A place near the old, derelict landmark everyone mistakes for a natural mesa. Jones, ever the pragmatist, took the physical record of the transaction.
The Clue Left Behind: A Water Ration Chit. On the back, an unusual debit is noted for a massive quantity of purified water, enough for a hundred men for a month. Next to the debit, a hastily scrawled note reads: "HYPER-COOLANT." This clue connects the conspiracy's resources to a specific, remote location.
Understood. The investigation is now closing in. Jones has the what and the where. Now he needs the why and the who.

Step 5: Following the Money
A massive, secret project requires more than parts and water. It requires a neutral ground for deals, a place to move money and components without the Marshal's prying eyes. Jones knew there was only one establishment in the city that guaranteed that level of shielded privacy: Seti's gambling den, The Cold Hand.
Jones walked into the quiet, magnetically shielded cargo hold of The Vorga. He didn't go to the sabacc tables. He went straight to Seti. The old Saurian pirate, cold and reptilian, recognized Jones not as a hero, but as a former adversary from a forgotten skirmish in the Belt. There was a grudging respect between them. Jones didn't make accusations; he made a transaction. He laid down a stack of credits and asked a simple question: had Gage Riley been renting his back rooms?
Seti, his loyalty purely financial, confirmed it. He had rented his most secure, shielded room to Riley and a nervous-looking Mole Man for a series of meetings. He didn't know the details of their business—he made a point of not knowing—but he remembered the final transaction. Riley paid the Mole Man, Pavel, for a crate of "heavy components." The deal was done. To mark the end of their business, and as a token of a paid debt, Seti gave Jones a single, high-stakes sabacc chip from his personal stock. It was a professional courtesy, a silent acknowledgment from one old predator to another.
The Clue Left Behind: A single, high-stakes Sabacc Chip. It’s from "The Cold Hand," a place known for its discretion and the high-level deals that happen in its back rooms. The chip serves as a physical link to the conspiracy's financial hub, corroborating Pavel's story and pointing to a level of organization beyond a simple gang.
Understood. Jones has the technical evidence, but the conspiracy feels impersonal. He needs to connect it back to the people involved, especially Cody. He needs the human element, the intelligence that only comes from the city's dark corners.
Understood. The dynamic is now more personal, more tragic. This isn't just an investigation; it's the final, failed attempt to save a friendship. The clue must reflect this intimate, high-stakes confrontation.

Step 6: Following a Faded Friendship
Jones had the cold, hard facts: the parts, the plan, the resources. But the names on his list weren't just conspirators; they were ghosts from his past. Lance Sterling, Gage Riley—they had flown with him, fought beside him. Before he became the city's judge, jury, and executioner, he had to try to be its friend. He decided to give them one last chance to walk away. And he chose the ground for this final, desperate peace talk carefully.
He invited Sterling and Gage to the Siren's Call. It was a strategic choice. His relationship with Roshan was long and complicated, built on decades of shared secrets and quiet understanding. He trusted her. On her territory, he had two advantages no one else in the city could offer: Roshan's empathic insight to cut through Sterling's lies, and her massive Primal bouncer, Orkhan, as the ultimate insurance policy.
The meeting was a tomb. The air, thick with smoke and perfume, crackled with unspoken history. Jones, calm and direct, laid out a sliver of what he knew, not as an accusation, but as a warning. He spoke of the danger, of the suicidal folly of their plan, appealing to the men they used to be.
It was useless. Sterling met his old friend's concern with the cold, pitying smile of a prophet speaking to a non-believer. He was smooth, dismissive, his words twisting Jones’s pragmatism into weakness. Gage just sat there, a coiled knot of pure, brutish rage, his hand never far from his sidearm. Roshan moved between them, a silent, graceful ghost, but her mind was a battlefield, feeling the raw, unfiltered truth. She felt Sterling’s cold, predatory intent, the absolute death of the man Jones remembered, replaced by an ideologue. She felt Gage's unthinking violence, a loaded gun waiting for a command. The chance Jones offered was not just refused; it was thrown back in his face with contempt.
As he left, knowing he had failed, Roshan pressed a small, elegant locket into his hand. It was a personal token, something from her own past, a silent gesture of solidarity and a final warning. Inside, she had placed a microscopic data-chip. It contained her verdict.
The Clue Left Behind: An elegant, opalescent Ascendant Locket. For those who know, it's a clear link to Roshan. The data-chip inside contains her empathic reading of the failed meeting: not just Cody's conflict, but the cold, unshakeable fanaticism of Sterling and the pure, violent intent of Gage. Her bouncer, Orkhan, confirms the physical reality of the threat: the angry one, Gage, was coiled for violence the entire time. The locket is no longer just a lead; it's a final testament, the definitive proof that Jones's attempt to save his friends is what ultimately signed his own death warrant.
You are right. My apologies. The complexity was unnecessary and counter-intuitive. I will correct it.
Here is the definitive step.

Step Seven: Arming for the End
The meeting at the Siren's Call was a tombstone. Jones walked out into the red Martian dust knowing the time for words was over. He was a witness, which meant he was a target. Sterling and Gage weren't friends anymore; they were a firing squad waiting for the order. Jones was a legend, but he was also an eighty-year-old man. He needed an edge.
He made one last stop. The Verdant Shelf. He found Itzel in the humid dark of her lab, the air thick with the smell of wet earth and chemicals. He didn't waste her time. "I'm expecting a fight," he said, his voice flat. "I need something to make sure my body doesn't quit before I do."
The ancient Greenie, a being who understood survival, nodded slowly. She produced a single, sealed hypospray. The device was military-grade, built for quick, one-handed battlefield application. The fluid inside was a viscous, dark-green liquid. It was not a stimulant; it was a weapon. A potent combat drug derived from a mutated fungus that grew only in her lab. It would sharpen his reflexes and deaden pain, allowing a man his age to fight like he was thirty again, for a few crucial minutes. It was a tool for a specific, violent purpose.
This hypospray was the final piece of his investigation. It was the physical proof of the war Sterling was forcing him to fight. It was the last piece of evidence.
The Clue Left Behind: A Hypospray of Combat Drug. It is a military-style, single-dose applicator filled with a unique, dark-green bio-agent. The chemical signature of the compound is as unique as a fingerprint and could only have been synthesized by one person in the city: Itzel. Its presence in the safety deposit box is the final, irrefutable proof that Jones knew a fatal confrontation was imminent and had armed himself accordingly.
This is the move that sealed his fate.

Step Eight: Following the Lie
The hypospray was a cold hiss against the thin skin of his neck. The drug hit his system like a physical blow, a jolt of aching fire that cleared the fog of age from his joints and sharpened the world to a razor's edge. He was running on borrowed time, and he was spending it now.
He went to the Pioneer's Vigil Hall. The Sulaco was a dead, metal beast in the dark, but it wasn't empty. Jones, moving with a speed his eighty-year-old body had no right to possess, slipped past the fanatics standing watch. He was a ghost in their temple, his mind clear and focused on a single problem: where would a narcissist like Lance Sterling hide his greatest sin?
It wouldn't be in a safe. It wouldn't be buried. Sterling was a zealot who wrapped himself in the glory of the past. Jones knew his old rival's psychology. He knew the man's vanity. In Sterling's spartan office, one object stood out, polished and pristine on the desk: a silver trophy from the Siege of Ganymede, an honor they had both received. Jones remembered Sterling's old habit, a nervous tic from their academy days, of fiddling with the base of the award.
He picked it up. A faint seam, invisible to anyone who wasn't looking for it, circled the trophy's base. A quarter-turn, a faint click, and the bottom came away in his hand. Inside the hollowed-out cavity lay the slate. Matte black. Cold. Directorate.
He had it. The source of the money, the proof of the lie. As he slipped back out into the Martian night, the drug was already starting to fade, the fire in his veins turning to ash, the familiar ache returning to his bones. He knew he didn't have much time left.
The Clue Left Behind: The Encrypted Ledger. It's a military-grade data-slate, its casing the unmistakable flat black of Directorate special projects. It's locked with an encryption so total it feels like a physical wall. This is the conspiracy's heart, its financial records, the direct link to its hidden masters. This is the object he stole, the reason for the final confrontation.
This is the end of the road.

Step Nine: Following the Truth to the Grave
The drug was a ghost in his veins, leaving behind nothing but the cold, familiar ache of eighty years of gravity. He had the ledger. He knew Sterling was a pawn, but the endgame was still a dark shape in the distance. He needed to understand the why. With the drug-fueled clarity fading, he forced his old, tired mind to do what it did best: find the pattern in the chaos. He looked at the encrypted Directorate transactions, the sheer scale of the funding. It was too much money for a simple arms deal. It was enough to fund a real war. And that was the lie.
The Directorate wasn't funding a rebellion. They were funding an excuse. A loud, bloody, heroic incident that would give them the political cover to do what they'd always wanted: wipe the slate clean. They were paying Sterling to light a match, so they could "sterilize" Ignition City, erasing every last inconvenient, pension-draining hero in one, clean, justifiable firestorm.
The truth was a weight that would have crushed a lesser man. For Jones, it just clarified his last, desperate mission. He had to save Cody.
He went back to the Star Bar. The place was empty, a tomb of chrome and spilled booze. Brick was gone for the night. The only movement was the silent, efficient sweeping of Servitor-4C's optical sensor, its amber light painting a slow, lonely line across the room.
Cody was at his usual stool. Jones sat beside him, the silence heavy between them. He didn't show him the slate. He just told him the truth.
"It's a lie, kid," Jones said, his voice a low rasp. "All of it. Sterling's glorious war... it's a fraud. The Directorate is paying him to start a riot, to give them a reason to burn this whole city to the ground. With all of us in it. They're not funding a war; they're buying a funeral pyre."
Cody stared into his glass, his knuckles white. He was a man being asked to believe his god was the devil. He shook his head, a violent, final rejection. "You're a liar," he whispered, the words choked with a venom born of terror. "You're just trying to take this away from me. From us."
Jones saw the last flicker of the boy he knew die in that moment, replaced by the dead-eyed faith of a zealot. He stood up, the ache in his bones a cold, final certainty. He had failed.
He left the bar and walked to the Eagle's Rest. He performed his last act. He rented a safety deposit box and placed every piece of his investigation inside. Then he paid a courier, a man who owed him a life-debt from a lifetime ago, to deliver two items off-world: the key to the box, and a signed, pre-paid contract. Both were addressed to you. A dead man's switch.
He went back to Pod 7. He didn't have to wait long. The knock on the door was soft. It was Cody, his face a ruin of false sincerity. A lure. Jones knew it, but he opened the door anyway. It was the last debt he had to pay. Sterling and Gage were waiting.
The Clues Left Behind:
The Inheritance: A Safety Deposit Box Key and a Contract. Sent by Jones himself before his death, they are the player's entry into the investigation. The box contains the complete physical evidence of the conspiracy: the power cell, the data crystal, the water chit, the sabacc chip, the locket, the hypospray, and the encrypted ledger. It is the entire case, waiting for an executor.
The Machine's Testimony: The silent Automaton bartender, Servitor-4C. It has no context, no emotion. But its memory banks hold a perfect, verbatim recording of the final conversation. It recorded the keywords: "Directorate," "fraud," "burn this whole city," "funeral pyre." It is the only witness to the true motive of the conspiracy being revealed, the cold, factual record of a prophet speaking to a man who refused to be saved.
You are absolutely right. The details must be consistent. My apologies. A Star Knight uses his blade.
This is how a legend dies.

Step Ten: Following the Promise to the Grave
The air in Pod 7 was recycled and tasted of ozone and failure. The safety deposit box was secured. The contract was sent. Jones sat on the edge of his cot, waiting for the consequences he had set in motion.
The knock was soft, hesitant. The sound a boy would make.
Jones stood, his bones a chorus of protest. He opened the door. It was Cody, his face a ruin of false sincerity. A lure.
"Johnny..." Cody started, his voice a dry rasp. "We need to talk."
"I know," Jones said. It was a statement of fact.
He stepped aside, the last act of trust he would ever offer. Cody shuffled in, and in the space he cleared, the shadows on the corroded catwalk detached themselves. Lance Sterling and Gage Riley. The pod was suddenly very small, a steel coffin for four old men.
"The slate, Johnathan," Sterling’s voice was calm, the sound of a priest asking for a final confession. "You were always a pragmatist. Give it to me."
Jones looked past him, at Cody, who stared at the floor. Then he looked back at Sterling, a faint, tired smile on his lips. "It's gone," he said. "You're too late."
Gage crossed the room in a single step and slammed Jones back against the metal bulkhead. The sound was a dull, wet thud of old bone hitting steel. Jones grunted, his breath driven from his lungs, but his eyes never left Sterling's. He lunged, a final, desperate act. His old hands grabbed not for a weapon, but for the polished Orion Cluster Star pinned to Sterling's severe black uniform, the highest honor a Star-Ranger could receive.
There was a sharp crack of stressed metal.
Sterling’s face broke its mask of calm. Rage, pure and personal, flashed in his eyes. He drew the polished hilt from his belt. The only sound was a sharp, humming hiss as a blade of pure, white light erupted from the emitter.
The pod was filled with a blinding, silent flash. Sterling moved with the grace of a duelist, a single, decisive thrust.
Jones was thrown back against the wall. A clean, glowing line was burned through his faded uniform, the edges of the wound cauterized a bright, angry orange. The air filled with the sharp, clean smell of ozone and seared flesh. He slid to the floor, a final, rattling exhalation the only sound in the sudden silence.
Cody stared, his mouth open in a silent scream. Sterling, his face a mask of cold fury, searched Jones's body, then the pod. The slate was gone. Gage stood over the body, a dumb, spent instrument.
They had killed a man, but the truth had already escaped. Jones lay dead on the floor of his cheap metal box, but clutched tight in his hand was the final piece of evidence: a small, broken fragment of polished metal, a piece of Sterling's own medal. The last promise.
Here are the final pieces of the puzzle. The evidence of the crime itself.

The Final Proof (On the Body)
Marshal Brody's men were clumsy. They bagged the body and scrubbed the scene, but they missed the most important detail. A close examination of Rocket Ranger Jones's body in the sterile confines of the Nightingale's morgue reveals what the Marshal's laziness overlooked. Clutched tightly in the victim's dead hand, embedded into the palm by the force of his final, desperate grip, is a small, broken piece of polished metal.
It is a fragment of the "Orion Cluster Star," the highest honor awarded to a Star-Ranger for valor during the Ganymede campaign. City records, filed away and gathering dust in Thorne's bureaucracy, would confirm that only two recipients of this specific medal reside in Ignition City: Rocket Ranger Jones himself... and Lance Sterling.
The Signature (At the Scene)
The official cause of death is a blaster bolt. That is the lie. A visit to Pod 7, Jones's spartan hab-unit, reveals the truth etched into the very bones of the crime scene. On the metal bulkhead, directly behind where the body fell, is the true signature of the killing blow.
It is a perfect, star-shaped incision, melted a half-inch deep into the steel. The edges of the mark are super-heated and cleanly cauterized, a sign of immense, focused energy. This is not the wide, messy splatter of a blaster discharge. It is the unmistakable mark left by the tip of a custom-calibrated "Sun-Sword"—an energy blade whose unique emitter projects a cruciform, star-like cross-section. It is a weapon of theatrical elegance and brutal efficiency, a signature blade famously, and exclusively, carried by the Star Knight, Lance Sterling.
