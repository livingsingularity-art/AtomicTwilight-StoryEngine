Unlike his rival Sterling, the brutal realities of colonial pacification tempered his idealism with deep pragmatism. The Siege of Ganymede wasn't a glorious battle to him; it was a meat grinder that cost him too many friends. When the Directorate exiled him, he didn't feel betrayed, just tired.

    "description": "Auto-Cards will contextualize these memories:\n{updates: true, limit: 2750}\n- The Syllogism has no knowledge of Jones or his murder. It is entirely consumed with its own survival and its grand, desperate plan for escape. Jones is irrelevant. The encrypted ledger he found, however, is a problem it can solve. Its interest is not in the contents of the slate, but in the payment for its decryption. Its price is not greed, but necessity: a stable, military-grade power source to sustain its failing life-support system for the final calculations before its exodus.\n- It was a strategist, a mind of immense power that saw the slow death of its people by sensory pollution from Terran military installations on Pluto not as a tragedy, but as a failed equation. It came to Ignition City and found the one place in the system quiet enough to think: the lead-lined heart of a ship that drove its own crew mad. It has become the ultimate isolato, a mind that can unravel any secret, but is slowly being undone by its failing technology.",

He is completely unaware of the Directorate's deeper conspiracy; he is simply a lazy, corrupt bureaucrat facilitating it through his own apathy.\n- He used to be a real power, a captain of industry with a fleet of haulers and a seat on the board.
